Capstone Project: Human Resource Management â€“ Testing with Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Page Object Model (POM)  

Completed a comprehensive capstone project focused on automated testing of the OrangeHRM application using Java, Selenium, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.  

* Project Highlights:  

- Automation Framework: Developed a robust automation framework leveraging the power of Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, integrated with TestNG for managing test execution and reporting.  
- Page Object Model (POM): Implemented the POM design pattern to enhance code reusability and maintainability, ensuring clean separation between test scripts and page-specific actions.  
- Test Coverage: Achieved extensive test coverage by automating key functionalities of the OrangeHRM application, including user authentication, employee management, leave management, and recruitment processes.  
- Data-Driven Testing: Incorporated data-driven testing methodologies to validate application behavior with various data sets, enhancing test robustness and reliability.  
- Continuous Integration: Integrated the framework with Jenkins for continuous integration, enabling automated test execution with every code commit and ensuring early detection of defects.  
- Reporting and Logging: Utilized advanced reporting and logging mechanisms to capture detailed test execution results and facilitate efficient debugging and analysis.  

* Technologies Used:  

- Programming Language: Java  
- Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver  
- Testing Framework: TestNG  
- Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)  
- Build Tool: Maven  
- Continuous Integration: Jenkins

This project has equipped me with a solid understanding of test automation best practices and enhanced my ability to deliver high-quality software through efficient and effective testing methodologies. I am excited to apply these skills in a professional setting and contribute to building reliable and scalable test automation solutions.
